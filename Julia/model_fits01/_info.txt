Here, the fitted models (NLMEM) will be stored.
For now, the folder is empty since each file takes ~ 400Mb,
GitHub does't allow to store such big files.

The `*.jld2` file formal is used.

File names indicates which scenario is stored, e.g.,
- `fitALT1_notrend_RND.jld2` -- ALT1 (treatment effect DE=0.5); notrend (no time trend added); RND (random allocation rule randomization);
- `fitNULL_trend_TBD.jld2`   -- NULL (treatment effect DE=0.0); trend   (time trend added);    TBD (truncated binomial design randomization);
- etc.
